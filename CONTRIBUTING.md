   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
````
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test thoroughly** - make sure instructions work

````
6. **Push to your fork**:

## Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Use fenced code blocks with language specified:
````markdown
```bash
  your command here
```
````
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italic* for technical terms
- Add emojis to headers for visual appeal (but don't overdo it)

### Code Style

- Use proper indentation (2 spaces for most files)
- Include comments for complex operations
- Test all commands before including them

### Writing Style

- **Be beginner-friendly** - assume minimal technical knowledge
- **Use clear, simple language**
- **Break complex steps** into smaller chunks
- **Add examples** whenever possible
- **Explain why**, not just how
